## Development

### Adding New Components

This project uses shadcn/ui for UI components. To add new components:

```sh
cd client
npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
```

### Language Support

The application supports multiple languages with automatic detection:

- **English (en)** - Default language
- **Arabic (ar)** - Full RTL support with proper text direction

To add a new language:

1. Create a new directory in `client/public/locales/[language-code]/`
2. Add a `translation.json` file with translated strings
3. The application will automatically detect and switch based on browser preferences

### API Endpoints

The server provides RESTful API endpoints:

- `GET /api/books` - Retrieve all books
- `POST /api/books` - Create a new book
- `DELETE /api/books/:id` - Delete a book
- `GET /api/authors` - Retrieve all authors
- `POST /api/authors` - Create a new author
- `DELETE /api/authors/:id` - Delete an author

### Customization

- **Books Data**: Edit `server/data/books.json` to modify the book collection
- **Authors Data**: Edit `server/data/authors.json` to manage authors
- **Translations**: Add or modify translations in `client/public/locales/`
- **UI Styling**: Customize components in `client/src/components/ui/`
- **Theme**: Configure themes in `client/src/components/themeprovider.tsx`
- **API Routes**: Add backend routes in `server/routes/`
- **Internationalization**: Configure i18n in `client/src/i18n.js`

### Pages

The application includes multiple pages with full internationalization:

- **Books**: Book collection browser and management with search and sort
- **Authors**: Author management with individual author profiles
- **Individual Book Pages**: Detailed view for each book with notes and metadata
- **Individual Author Pages**: Detailed author profiles and their works
- **Data**: Data visualization and analytics dashboard
- **Settings**: Application configuration, theme, and language preferences
